# pinnedai — 4-week MVP roadmap

Started **2026-05-18**. Target: working npm package + GitHub Action + landing page + hosted OIDC endpoint + 3 design partners signed up by **2026-06-22** (one-week slip from original 06-15 to accommodate the hosted Worker — explicit trade-off for keyless Free-tier onboarding; see `[[oidc-hosted-endpoint-mvp]]` memory).

- **npm**: `pinnedai` (binary: `pinned`)
- **Website**: `pinnedai.dev` (to register)
- **Repo**: `github.com/pinnedai/pinnedai`

---

## Week 0 — scaffold

- [x] Folder structure, pnpm workspace, TypeScript config
- [x] CLI shell: `pinned check`, `pinned generate`, `pinned retire` commands stubbed
- [x] GitHub Action manifest (composite action wrapping `npx pinnedai`)
- [x] CI workflow on the repo itself
- [x] README + ROADMAP
- [x] `pnpm install && pnpm build` runs clean
- [x] Reserve `pinnedai` on npm — **published 0.0.1 as placeholder, name secured**
- [ ] First commit + push to `pinnedai/pinnedai`
- [ ] Register `pinnedai.dev` domain

## Week 1 — Foundation + Template 1 (rate-limit)

- [x] Claim parser: regex matchers for `rate-limit(s|ed) /route to N req/min` and `rate-limit /route to N rpm` forms. Returns structured `{template, route, rate, window, raw}`.
- [x] Test generator for `rate-limit:<route>:<rate>`. Emits a burst-parallel Vitest test file.
- [x] `pinned generate --pr-id X --description "..."` writes test files to `tests/pinned/`. Idempotent (skips existing claims). `--dry-run` prints instead.
- [x] `pinned init` scaffolds `.github/workflows/pinned.yml` + `tests/pinned/` in the customer's repo (one-command onboarding).
- [x] `pinned list` shows pinned + retired claims for daily-loop visibility.
- [x] `pinned retire <id> --reason="..."` moves to `retired/` + writes `<id>.audit.json` audit entry.
- [x] **`pinned try` (default command)** — zero-config demo, runs end-to-end on a sample PR body. The tweet→terminal onboarding moment.
- [x] **Landing page at `apps/landing/`** with interactive live demo + regression simulator. Imports parser/template from `apps/cli/src/index.ts` (single source of truth, browser-safe).
- [x] Configurable `PREVIEW_URL` env var for behavioral tests (generated tests fail loudly if unset).
- [x] Vitest unit tests for the parser — 25 tests, all green.
- [x] **PINS.md auto-maintained registry** + `.registry.json` source-of-truth — rank-2 sticky feature.
- [x] **`pinned scan-diff`** — "No proof found" detector, rank-3 sticky feature. 13 unit tests green.
- [ ] LLM fallback when regex returns 0 claims (seam left clean — wires to Worker in week 3).
- [ ] Local end-to-end: spin up a localhost rate-limited toy server and confirm a generated test actually fails on regression.

## Week 2 — GitHub Action + PR comment + templates 2+3

- [x] Vitest unit tests for `claimParser.ts` — 25 tests green.
- [x] Vitest unit tests for `scanDiff.ts` — 13 tests green.
- [x] Action triggers on `pull_request: [opened, synchronize, edited]`, parses body from event payload.
- [x] PR comment posted via `gh pr comment` (uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`) — currently posts scan-diff suggestions, not generated tests.
- [x] Multi-claim support (one PR description → multiple test files written by `pinned generate`).
- [x] Friendly "no claims found" path with examples.
- [x] Template 2: `auth-required:<route>`. Single request to the route, expects 401/403.
- [x] Template 3: `idempotent:<webhook>:<id-field>`. Fires same payload twice, asserts byte-identical response.
- [ ] **Deferred to v0.1.1:** PR comment also includes the *generated test file content* for paste-in mode. (Today: comment includes pin suggestions only; customer runs `pinned generate` locally to write tests.)

## Week 3 — Hosted OIDC endpoint + always-LLM + abuse protection

- [x] Cloudflare Worker scaffolded at `apps/edge/` (private repo target).
- [x] OIDC JWT validation against `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/jwks` (cache JWKS, verify signature, check audience).
- [x] Per-repo monthly quota counter in Cloudflare D1 (Free = 100 calls/repo/mo).
- [x] OpenAI proxy endpoint scaffolded — needs always-LLM + content-hash cache wiring.
- [x] CLI scaffolds the OIDC token fetch from Actions runtime (`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL`).
- [ ] **PIVOT: always-call LLM** (not "fallback when regex returns 0"). Run regex AND LLM, union results, dedupe. Drives coverage from ~70% to ~95%.
- [ ] **SHA-256 content-hash cache** in D1 (30-day TTL). Cache hits don't count toward quota — PR sync events become free.
- [ ] **BYOK paths in CLI** — detect `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` env vars (Pro tier feature), call directly without going through our Worker. License-check gates it.
- [ ] **Abuse protection layers**:
  - Per-repo monthly cap: 100 calls (Free) / 1,000 (Pro) / pooled 10K (Team)
  - Per-repo daily cap: 20 calls/day (Free) — prevents burning monthly cap in 1 hour
  - Per-IP rate limit: 30 req/min (Cloudflare native)
  - Body size cap: 50KB max (already in place)
  - Public-repo eval doesn't apply (we allow private on Free)
- [ ] `GET /admin/stats` JSON endpoint on Worker, auth-gated with `ADMIN_KEY` secret. Returns: active repos this month, total calls, OpenAI cost estimate, top consumers. v0.1.1 = visual dashboard reads this.
- [ ] Worker deployed to `https://api.pinnedai.dev`.
- [ ] **Repo split**: move `apps/edge/` to `pinnedai/pinnedai-edge` (private) before first public push. Keep `apps/cli/` + `apps/landing/` in `pinnedai/pinnedai` (public).

## Week 4 — Landing deploy + Marketplace + demo recording

- [ ] Landing page deployed to Vercel at `pinnedai.dev` (domain registered).
- [ ] Update Free-tier copy on landing: "100 LLM calls/repo/mo via OIDC — no API key needed."
- [ ] Record demo GIF: open PR with rate-limit claim → Action posts comment → paste test → merge → push regression commit → CI fails with back-reference.
- [ ] GitHub Marketplace submission for `pinnedai/pinnedai` repo.
- [ ] First end-to-end demo on a real toy repo (publicly linkable).

## Week 5 — Launch

- [ ] `npm publish pinnedai@0.1.0` (bump from placeholder 0.0.1).
- [ ] Launch posts: Show HN, r/devsecops, r/javascript, dev.to.
- [ ] Outreach to 20 names from X/Twitter network (Cursor / Claude Code / Devin power users).
- [ ] Goal: 3 design partners signed up by end of week.
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI bill daily during the first week; ratchet Free quota down if a single repo dominates spend.

## Pre-launch product pivot (2026-05-23 — supersedes the "PR claims → tests" wedge framing)

The first ~5 weeks built the deterministic engine (templates, registry, scan-diff, auto-detection, GitHub Action). Calibration with `pinned backtest` on real OSS + Quantasyte revealed the engine works but the **wedge needs to shift**: random commit sweeps produced 0 practical "saves" (only lockfile noise, since demoted). The strongest provable framing is:

> **Every bug fix becomes a verified regression guard, and Pinned finds sibling spots that may have the same bug.**

Anchor memories: [[five-strong-saves-launch-gate]], [[fifteen-positive-controls-launch-spec]], [[llm-proposer-deterministic-verifier-split]], [[three-mode-llm-architecture]].

**Launch gate**: ≥10 of 15 positive-control fixtures must produce a real-catch verdict (fail at parent, pass at fix), AND ≥5 quantasyte fix commits must produce real-catches with LLM-assisted detection.

### Shipped this session (2026-05-23)

- [x] **Bug-fix benchmark mode** (`pinned backtest --mode=bug-fix`) — mines fix-shaped commits, generates pins at the fix, replays against parent. "Real catch" = fail-at-parent + pass-at-fix.
- [x] **Lockfile-integrity demoted** to high-signal triggers only (silent regen / lockfile removed / pm switched). Routine dep updates suppressed by package.json-delta gating.
- [x] **pnpm-workspace.yaml + lerna.json support** across all detectors (cli/exports/secret/auth). Closed a silent dogfood gap — pinnedai's own CLI binary was undetectable from its own repo before this.
- [x] **Two real FPs in `secret-not-public`** template fixed (`ORG_INVITE_SECRET`/`INVITE_SECRET` substring matching `VITE_SECRET`; `VITE_API_KEYS_ENABLED` matching `API_KEY`). Added identifier-boundary lookbehind + complete-segment lookahead.
- [x] **Diff-aware `auth-required` detector + static-mode template** — pure regex over `git diff`, captures the auth-check signature at pin time, runs without a live server. Foundation for the LLM-proposer (which generalizes across naming conventions).

### To ship before v0.1 launch (in order)

- [ ] **15 positive-control fixtures** (task #7) — small Express/Supabase repos with parent-buggy + child-fixed commits across the 8 promise categories (auth, role, tenant scoping, tier cap, webhook idempotency, rate limit, billing downgrade, duplicate prevention). Live in `audit/positive-controls/`. Each fixture must produce a real-catch verdict under `pinned backtest --mode=bug-fix`.
- [ ] **Router→controller resolution** (task #13) — `detectReturnsStatusPins` only fires when validation is inline in route-handler files; misses Express MVC / NestJS / Quantasyte's shape where the validation lives in `controllers/` imported by a thin router file. Without this, several of the 15 fixtures (tier-cap, duplicate-prevention, quota-bypass) can't generate the right pin shape.
- ~~**LLM-as-proposer wiring**~~ — **DESCOPED FROM PRE-LAUNCH** (2026-05-23). Deterministic detectors already produce 8 catches on quantasyte (past the [[five-strong-saves-launch-gate]] threshold), so LLM isn't required to prove launch value. BYOK path shipped as Pro-only opt-in (`PINNEDAI_BYOK=anthropic|openai`, see `apps/cli/src/llmBugFixPropose.ts`). Worker-mediated free-tier LLM deferred to v0.2 (task #21). Marketing pivot: *"Pinned doesn't need an LLM to enforce guards."* Lower cost, higher trust, cleaner positioning.
- [ ] **Sibling-bug discovery** (task #12) — after a fix→guard is replay-verified, scan the repo for other surfaces matching the same pattern but missing the same protection signature. Surface as **opt-in** "Related guards" suggestions, never auto-pin. Reuses `AUTH_CHECK_PATTERNS` (already exported from `scanDiff.ts` for this purpose). GPT framing: *"◆ Pinned · VERIFIED GUARD … Related protection opportunities: + /api/admin/users + /api/admin/billing"*.
- [ ] **Guard-removal blocker** (task #8) — independent, high-frequency "save" event. Detect when a commit deletes/skips/weakens any `tests/pinned/*` file or removes Pinned from CI. Block via pre-commit + pre-push + exit code 2. Allow `pinned approve-removal <id> --reason "..."` with audit trail. AI agents "fix failing tests" by deleting them constantly — this is one of the most frequent purchaseable moments.
- [ ] **Final launch backtest** (task #11) — run benchmark against (a) all 15 fixtures, (b) quantasyte with LLM enabled. Honest scorecard: "N/15 fixtures produced real-catch; M quantasyte fix-commits produced real-catches; K required manual template tuning." Threshold for launch: ≥10/15 + ≥5 quantasyte. Below threshold → do not announce launch; iterate on detectors / LLM prompt / templates.

### What changes in marketing/positioning when this lands

Old (current landing copy):
- *"Turn PR claims into permanent CI tests."*

New (per [[fifteen-positive-controls-launch-spec]] + GPT framing):
- *"Every bug fix becomes a permanent regression guard — and Pinned finds sibling spots that may have the same bug."*

Statusline + status messages also shift: `◆ Pinned · 34 pins · 1 to review` → outcome-based states `PASS / SAVED / COVERED / BLOCK / VERIFIED GUARD`. Spec'd but not yet implemented; goes with the launch.

## Deferred to v0.1.1 (post-launch)

- Per-org dashboard (if any users actually ask for it; otherwise keep it CLI-only).
- LLM-diff-to-claim inference ("Inferred" mode) — when PR description is bare, infer claims FROM the diff.
- Method slot in templates (GET vs POST for auth-required, etc.) — Claim type extension.
- `pinned doctor` checks PREVIEW_URL based on registry's active pins, not directory listing.

## Possible v0.2+ product feature

**Pinnedai-as-code-review-bundler.** The workflow we developed for shipping code to GPT (self-contained bundles with embedded prompts, round-numbering on iterations) could become a pinnedai feature itself: `pinned review-bundle` generates a self-contained text file with the review prompt + relevant source code, ready to paste into Claude / GPT / Gemini for a bug audit. Tied to the wedge because the bundles include the customer's pins as part of the review context. See `[[code-review-bundle-workflow]]` memory for the workflow that inspired this.

## Post-MVP (v0.2+) — expansion paths in priority order

### New claim templates (order driven by design-partner feedback)

Shipping with **9 templates** in v0.1: rate-limit, auth-required, idempotent, returns-status, cli-output-contains, cli-exits-zero, cli-creates-file, cli-flag-supported, library-returns.

Deferred templates — add the first 2-3 based on actual customer requests, NOT speculation:

| Template | Example claim | Why valuable |
|---|---|---|
| `response-shape` | "/api/users returns `{id, email}` only — never `password_hash`" | Data-leak protection. #1 AI regression class. |
| `row-limit` | "/api/list returns ≤100 items per page" | Pagination drift is silent + common. |
| `role-required` (with non-admin token fixture) | "/api/admin/export requires admin role" | True role-fixture testing. v0.1 maps this phrasing to auth-required (route-not-public). Real version needs `PINNEDAI_NONADMIN_TOKEN` env. |
| `env-required` | "Requires DATABASE_URL env var" | Already a scanDiff suggestion; just no template yet. |
| `cli-exits-nonzero` | "`pinned generate --pr-id ../etc` exits 1" | Inverse of cli-exits-zero — for error-path claims. |
| `schema-migration-reversible` | "Migration `0042_add_user_role` is reversible" | Database safety. Niche but compelling for compliance customers. |

The README's CLI table + `What you can claim` section both invite issue requests for templates not yet supported. We add when demand exists.

### Other v0.2+ expansion paths

1. ~~**LLM diff-to-claim inference**~~ — **PROMOTED TO PRE-LAUNCH** as task #10 ("LLM-as-proposer"). Same feature, was previously framed as a v0.2 add when the wedge was "PR claims → tests"; now load-bearing for the bug-fix-mode benchmark since regex misses custom-naming helpers like Quantasyte's `authHeaders()`.
2. **Custom claim templates**: customers define their own template patterns
3. **Org policies**: "every PR must pin ≥1 claim" (Team tier feature)
4. **Slack alerts** on claim breaks in main (Team tier)
5. **Multi-language**: today Vitest/Node only. Add Python/pytest, Go/test, Ruby/rspec.
6. **Self-hosted runner** (Enterprise tier)
7. **SOC 2 / ISO 27001 audit-trail export** — every claim becomes a signed change-management evidence entry
8. ~~**Router→controller import resolution for `returns-status` detector**~~ — **PROMOTED TO PRE-LAUNCH** as task #13. Today the detector only finds inline validation in `routes/`, `app/api/`, `pages/api/` files. Architectures where validation lives in `controllers/` (Express MVC, NestJS, quantasyte's shape) are missed because the route is mounted in a separate router file. Without this, `returns-status` (one of the 8 high-value promise categories from [[fifteen-positive-controls-launch-spec]]) can't fire on a huge slice of real repos. Fix: TS import resolution from router → controller (or a regex+heuristic compromise), then check the controller for validation calls.
9. **Rush / Deno monorepo support**: today we read `package.json#workspaces` (npm/yarn/bun), `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and `lerna.json`. Rush (`rush.json` → `projects: [{ packageName, projectFolder }]`) and Deno workspaces (`deno.json` → `workspace: [...]`) are out of scope for v0.1 — niche and different shape. Add when a real user asks.
10. ~~**Lateral pattern propagation from a single fix**~~ — **PROMOTED TO PRE-LAUNCH** (see the "Pre-launch product pivot" section above). The wedge requires it: a fix→guard that ONLY protects the one route the user fixed isn't a strong enough purchaseable moment vs. a fix→guard + sibling protections across the repo. Tracked as task #12 (deterministic v1 shipped).
11. **LLM-based sibling discovery (v2)**: today's sibling discovery (task #12) is deterministic — walks repo files, filters by path-prefix + regex pattern absence. Works for obvious siblings (`/api/admin/*` after a catch on `/api/admin/export`). Misses semantic siblings where the path doesn't obviously match (e.g., `/api/reports/internal-stats` is admin-shaped but doesn't share the prefix). LLM v2 would: walk repo, send file paths + headers (not full content — minimum-necessary context per [[three-mode-llm-architecture]]) to LLM, ask "given the catch on `<triggerFile>` for template `<X>`, which of these files look semantically similar?" — receives ranked list of high-confidence siblings. Separate LLM call from the bug-fix proposer; deferred until the bug-fix LLM is proven and we have evidence regex-v1 siblings are missing meaningful FNs.

## Honest risks tracker

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| LLM hallucinates wrong claim → wrong test → user loses trust | Constrained template generation — LLM only fills slots, never writes test logic. Only ship templates where the pattern is deterministic. |
| Behavioral tests need a running app | v1 requires `PREVIEW_URL` env var. Most Vercel/Netlify users already have this. v0.2 adds "spin up local server in CI" mode. |
| Auto-generated tests in customer repos feel intrusive | Default mode is "paste-in-comment", not auto-commit. Auto-commit is opt-in (Pro feature). |
| CodeRabbit / Greptile ships the same feature | Persistence is the moat. Generating *tests in the codebase* is architecturally different from posting review comments. Their codebase doesn't easily pivot. |
| Customer has no preview deploy | v0.2 adds "unit test mode" — generated tests use mocks instead of HTTP calls. Weaker evidence but works without preview deploys. |
